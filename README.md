# Home Assistant KNX integration
Hi ðŸ‘‹! This is a proxy repository for the Home Assistant KNX integration to track issues, feature requests, discussions etc.

Since KNX is a core integration, its code is hosted in the [Home Assistant Core Repository](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/knx).
The [integrations unit tests](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/tests/components/knx) can also be found there and the official integrations documentation is hosted in the [Home Assistant documentation repo](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io/blob/current/source/_integrations/knx.markdown).

The integration uses following libraries:
- [`xknx`](https://github.com/XKNX/xknx), the library used for KNX IP connection handling, DPT decoding and providing device abstractions
- The [`knx-frontend`](https://github.com/XKNX/knx-frontend) Home Assistant panel
- [`xknxproject`](https://github.com/XKNX/xknxproject), the ETS project file parser
